# Valve Room VR (Training Simulation)

VR training portfolio project for Meta Quest: interactive maintenance workflow with checklist steps, error handling, and comfort-first locomotion.

## Goals
- XR interaction patterns (grab/rotate/activate)
- Comfort locomotion (teleport + snap turn)
- VR UX and performance discipline

## Skills Demonstrated
- XR Interaction Toolkit usage (grab, rotate, interactables)
- VR locomotion comfort standards (teleport, snap turn, comfort-first defaults)
- VR UX patterns (checklist UI on wrist/tablet, readable spacing, feedback)
- Validation & error handling (wrong object/sequence/direction)
- Performance discipline for standalone VR (profiling mindset, lightweight assets)
- Scenario scripting and state-driven flow (step-by-step training logic)

## Core Gameplay
Follow a checklist to perform maintenance steps in a valve room: identify the correct valve, interact, verify results, and complete the scenario.

## Planned Features
- Checklist UI (wrist/tablet)
- Validation & error system (wrong object, wrong direction, skipped steps)
- Hints (highlight, guidance)
- Final score (time, mistakes, pass/fail)

## Tech
- Unity 2022.3 LTS
- XR Interaction Toolkit
- (Optional) Meta XR SDK

## How to Run
1. Open with Unity 2022.3 LTS
2. Load scene: `Boot` → `MainMenu` → `Gameplay`

## Status
In development.
